#Â Spotify Notification

Display the current playing track in Spotify in Notification Center on OS X
Mountain Lion and above.

I usually have the Apple Script menu showing, so I can just run the script from
there when Spotify is running. Turn that on in AppleScript Editor preferences:

Put the script into ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Spotify, and call it what
you want. When Spotify is the focus, you'll have the script at the bottom of
the script menu (notice I renamed mine to "What's playing")
